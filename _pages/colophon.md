This site is a fork of the [Minimal Mistakes][1] theme for the [Jekyll][2] framework. Pages are written in [Markdown][3] using [Ulysses][4] for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages][5], and I use [Tower][6] for Mac as a git GUI. The entire site is stored in [Dropbox][7] for easy editing anywhere, on any device.

The main body font is [Activ Grotesk][8], and the figure captions are [Proxima Nova][9]. Both fonts can be found as part of Adobe's [TypeKit][10].

[Atom][11] for Mac is used to edit HTML, CSS, YAML, JavaScript, and [Liquid][12].
