This site is a fork of the [Minimal Mistakes][1] theme for the [Jekyll][2] framework. Pages are written in [Markdown][3] using [Ulysses][4] for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages][5], and I use [Tower][6] for Mac and [Working Copy][7] for iOS as a git GUI. The entire site is stored in [Dropbox][8] for easy editing anywhere, on any device.

The main body font is [Activ Grotesk][9], and the figure captions are [Proxima Nova][10]. Both fonts can be found as part of Adobe's [TypeKit][11].

[Atom][12] for Mac is used to edit HTML, CSS, YAML, JavaScript, and [Liquid][13].
